# Task: Create RFC Compliance Test Infrastructure

## Description  
Create comprehensive test infrastructure in `tests/rfc_compliance/` that mirrors the exact directory structure of `docs/` for systematic YAML 1.2 specification testing.

## Target Files
- **Primary**: `tests/rfc_compliance/` (new directory structure)
- **Subdirectories**: ch05_character_productions/, ch06_structural_productions/, ch07_flow_style/, ch08_block_style/, ch09_document_stream/, ch10_schemas/
- **Integration**: `tests/mod.rs` or `Cargo.toml` test configuration

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Directory structure exactly mirrors docs/ organization
- [ ] tests/rfc_compliance/ch05_character_productions/ created with test file templates
- [ ] tests/rfc_compliance/ch06_structural_productions/ created with test file templates  
- [ ] tests/rfc_compliance/ch07_flow_style/ created with test file templates
- [ ] tests/rfc_compliance/ch08_block_style/ created with test file templates
- [ ] tests/rfc_compliance/ch09_document_stream/ created with test file templates
- [ ] tests/rfc_compliance/ch10_schemas/ created with test file templates
- [ ] Test file naming convention matches spec sections (test_5_1_character_set.rs, etc.)
- [ ] Basic test framework setup with common utilities module

## Implementation Notes
- **Structure**: Exact mirror of docs/ directory structure for traceability
- **Naming**: Test files named after spec sections for easy cross-reference
- **Framework**: Use standard Rust testing with common utilities for YAML parsing
- **Templates**: Create template test files with placeholder test functions
- **Utilities**: Common test utilities for YAML parsing and validation

## Dependencies  
- **Can Run In Parallel**: This task can start immediately and run parallel with implementation
- **No Blocking Dependencies**: Test infrastructure independent of implementation

## Complexity Estimate
**Low-Medium** - Primarily directory and file creation with basic test templates

## Constraints
- DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA
- Make ONLY MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required
- Use expect() in tests/* (allowed in test code)
- DO NOT use unwrap() in tests/* (still not allowed)
