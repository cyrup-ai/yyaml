# TODO.md - Fix All Compilation Errors and Warnings

## CURRENT ERRORS (32 total) - MUST BE FIXED TO 0

### Function Pointer Type Mismatches in src/semantic/tags.rs

1. [x] **Fix HashMap function pointer type inference in CoreSchema::new()** - Lines 611-622 have type mismatch errors where HashMap expects consistent function types but gets different fn items. Need to use Box<dyn Fn> or function pointer casting. âœ… FIXED: Added explicit function pointer casting `as fn(&str) -> Option<YamlType>`

2. [ ] **Act as an Objective Rust Expert** - Rate the quality of the fix on a scale of 1-10. Provide specific feedback on type safety and performance implications.

3. [x] **Fix HashMap function pointer type inference in JsonSchema::new()** - Similar issues in lines 647-653 with type resolvers HashMap. âœ… FIXED: Applied same function pointer casting

4. [ ] **Act as an Objective Rust Expert** - Rate the quality of the fix on a scale of 1-10. Provide specific feedback on consistency with CoreSchema fix.

5. [x] **Fix HashMap function pointer type inference in FailsafeSchema::new()** - Similar issues in lines 673-675 with type resolvers HashMap. âœ… FIXED: Applied same function pointer casting

6. [ ] **Act as an Objective Rust Expert** - Rate the quality of the fix on a scale of 1-10. Provide specific feedback on schema implementation coherence.

### Borrowing Conflicts in src/semantic/anchors.rs

7. [x] **Fix double mutable borrow in resolve_alias()** - Line 144: Cannot borrow `*self` as mutable more than once. First borrow at line 134 for anchor lookup, second at line 144 for recursive resolution. âœ… FIXED: Restructured to extract node and update count in scoped block to avoid overlapping borrows

8. [ ] **Act as an Objective Rust Expert** - Rate the quality of the fix on a scale of 1-10. Provide specific feedback on memory safety and performance.

9. [x] **Fix lifetime issue in resolve_all_aliases()** - Line 415: `anchor_name` does not live long enough for 'input lifetime requirement. âœ… FIXED: Changed from Cow::Borrowed to Cow::Owned

10. [ ] **Act as an Objective Rust Expert** - Rate the quality of the fix on a scale of 1-10. Provide specific feedback on lifetime management.

11. [x] **Fix move-after-borrow in resolve_all_aliases()** - Line 416: Cannot move `anchor_name` because it's borrowed in line 415. âœ… FIXED: Issue resolved by using Cow::Owned with clone()

12. [ ] **Act as an Objective Rust Expert** - Rate the quality of the fix on a scale of 1-10. Provide specific feedback on ownership semantics.

### Value Move Issues in src/semantic/mod.rs

13. [x] **Fix moved value access in resolve_sequence_node()** - Line 373: `seq_node.items` moved by into_iter() but then accessed by index assignment. âœ… FIXED: Used into_iter() to collect resolved items into new Vec, then assigned back to avoid borrowing conflicts

14. [ ] **Act as an Objective Rust Expert** - Rate the quality of the fix on a scale of 1-10. Provide specific feedback on collection iteration patterns.

15. [x] **Fix temporary reference return in get_analysis_metrics()** - Line 425: Cannot return reference to temporary value AnalysisMetrics::default(). âœ… FIXED: Changed return type from &AnalysisMetrics to AnalysisMetrics to return owned value

16. [ ] **Act as an Objective Rust Expert** - Rate the quality of the fix on a scale of 1-10. Provide specific feedback on reference lifetime design.

### Missing Trait Implementations 

17. [x] **Implement Hash for YamlType** - Type needed Hash trait for use as HashMap key. âœ… FIXED: Added Hash to derive macro

18. [ ] **Act as an Objective Rust Expert** - Rate the quality of the fix on a scale of 1-10. Provide specific feedback on display formatting.

19. [x] **Implement Default for GraphMetadata** - Type needed Default but Instant doesn't implement Default. âœ… FIXED: Removed Default from derive and implemented manually

20. [ ] **Act as an Objective Rust Expert** - Rate the quality of the fix on a scale of 1-10. Provide specific feedback on cloning strategy.

21. [x] **Fix Stream IntoIterator usage** - Stream doesn't implement IntoIterator. âœ… FIXED: Changed to access .documents field directly

23. [ ] **Fix resolve_tag_prefix method missing in AnalysisContext** - Method called but not implemented.

24. [ ] **Act as an Objective Rust Expert** - Rate the quality of the fix on a scale of 1-10. Provide specific feedback on API completeness.

25. [ ] **Fix yaml_version method missing in AnalysisContext** - Method called but not implemented.

26. [ ] **Act as an Objective Rust Expert** - Rate the quality of the fix on a scale of 1-10. Provide specific feedback on version handling.

### Constructor Missing Errors

27. [ ] **Implement missing constructors for AST node types** - SequenceNode::new, MappingNode::new, etc. called but not implemented.

28. [ ] **Act as an Objective Rust Expert** - Rate the quality of the fix on a scale of 1-10. Provide specific feedback on constructor design.

29. [ ] **Implement missing MappingPair::new constructor** - Called in anchors.rs but not implemented.

30. [ ] **Act as an Objective Rust Expert** - Rate the quality of the fix on a scale of 1-10. Provide specific feedback on pair construction.
