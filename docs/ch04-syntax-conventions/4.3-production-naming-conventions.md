# 4.3. Production Naming Conventions

To make it easier to follow production combinations, production names use a prefix-style naming convention. Each production is given a prefix based on the type of characters it begins and ends with.

## `e-`

A production matching no characters.

## `c-`

A production starting and ending with a special character.

## `b-`

A production matching a single [line break](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#line-break-characters).

## `nb-`

A production starting and ending with a non-[break](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#line-break-characters) character.

## `s-`

A production starting and ending with a [white space](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#white-space-characters) character.

## `ns-`

A production starting and ending with a non-[space](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#white-space-characters) character.

## `l-`

A production matching complete line(s).

## `X-Y-`

A production starting with an `X-` character and ending with a `Y-` character, where `X-` and `Y-` are any of the above prefixes.

## `X+`, `X-Y+`

A production as above, with the additional property that the matched content [indentation](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#indentation-spaces) level is greater than the specified `n` parameter.
