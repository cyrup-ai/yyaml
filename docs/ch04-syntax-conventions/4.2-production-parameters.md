# 4.2. Production Parameters

Some productions have parameters in parentheses after the name, such as [`s-line-prefix(n,c)`](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#rule-s-line-prefix). A parameterized production is shorthand for a (infinite) series of productions, each with a fixed value for each parameter.

For instance, this production:

```
production-a(n) ::= production-b(n)
```

Is shorthand for:

```
production-a(0) ::= production-b(0)
production-a(1) ::= production-b(1)
…
```

And this production:

```
production-a(n) ::=
  ( production-b(n+m) production-c(n+m) )+
```

Is shorthand for:

```
production-a(0) ::=
    ( production-b(0) production-c(0) )+
  | ( production-b(1) production-c(1) )+
  | …
production-a(1) ::=
    ( production-b(1) production-c(1) )+
  | ( production-b(2) production-c(2) )+
  | …
…
```

The parameters are as follows:

## Indentation: `n` or `m`

May be any natural number, including zero. `n` may also be -1.

## Context: `c`

This parameter allows productions to tweak their behavior according to their surrounding. YAML supports two groups of *contexts*, distinguishing between [block styles](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#block-style-productions) and [flow styles](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#flow-style-productions).

May be any of the following values:

- `BLOCK-IN` – inside block context
- `BLOCK-OUT` – outside block context
- `BLOCK-KEY` – inside block key context
- `FLOW-IN` – inside flow context
- `FLOW-OUT` – outside flow context
- `FLOW-KEY` – inside flow key context

## (Block) Chomping: `t`

The [line break](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#line-break-characters) chomping behavior for flow scalars. May be any of the following values:

- `STRIP` – remove all trailing newlines
- `CLIP` – remove all trailing newlines except the first
- `KEEP` – retain all trailing newlines
