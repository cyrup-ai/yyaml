# Chapter 4. Syntax Conventions

The following chapters formally define the syntax of YAML character [streams](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#streams), using parameterized BNF productions. Each BNF production is both named and numbered for easy reference. Whenever possible, basic structures are specified before the more complex structures using them in a "bottom up" fashion.

The productions are accompanied by examples which are presented in a two-pane side-by-side format. The left-hand side is the YAML example and the right-hand side is an alternate YAML view of the example. The right-hand view uses JSON when possible. Otherwise it uses a YAML form that is as close to JSON as possible.
