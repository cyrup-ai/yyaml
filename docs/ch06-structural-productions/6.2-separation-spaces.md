# 6.2. Separation Spaces

Outside [indentation](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#indentation-spaces) and [scalar content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#scalar), YAML uses [white space](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#white-space-characters) characters for *separation* between tokens within a line. Note that such [white space](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#white-space-characters) may safely include [tab](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#white-space-characters) characters.

Separation spaces are a [presentation detail](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#presenting-the-serialization-tree) and must not be used to convey [content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) information.

**Example 6.3 Separation Spaces**

| ``` -·foo:→·bar - -·baz   -→baz ``` | ```json [ { "foo": "bar" },   [ "baz",     "baz" ] ] ``` |
| --- | --- |
