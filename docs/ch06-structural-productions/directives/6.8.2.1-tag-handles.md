# 6.8.2.1. Tag Handles

The *tag handle* exactly matches the prefix of the affected [tag shorthand](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tag-shorthands). There are three tag handle variants:

```
[89] c-tag-handle ::=
    c-named-tag-handle
  | c-secondary-tag-handle
  | c-primary-tag-handle
```

## Primary Handle

The *primary tag handle* is a single "`!`" character. This allows using the most compact possible notation for a single "primary" name space. By default, the prefix associated with this handle is "`!`". Thus, by default, [shorthands](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tag-shorthands) using this handle are interpreted as [local tags](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tags).

It is possible to override the default behavior by providing an explicit " `TAG` " directive, associating a different prefix for this handle. This provides smooth migration from using [local tags](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tags) to using [global tags](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tags) by the simple addition of a single " `TAG` " directive.

```
[90] c-primary-tag-handle ::= '!'
```

**Example 6.18 Primary Tag Handle**

| ``` # Private !foo "bar" ... # Global %TAG ! tag:example.com,2000:app/ --- !foo "bar" ``` | ```json !<!foo> "bar" --- !<tag:example.com,2000:app/foo> "bar" ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Secondary Handle

The *secondary tag handle* is written as "`!!`". This allows using a compact notation for a single "secondary" name space. By default, the prefix associated with this handle is " `tag:yaml.org,2002:`".

It is possible to override this default behavior by providing an explicit " `TAG` " directive associating a different prefix for this handle.

```
[91] c-secondary-tag-handle ::= "!!"
```

**Example 6.19 Secondary Tag Handle**

| ``` %TAG !! tag:example.com,2000:app/ --- !!int 1 - 3 # Interval, not integer ``` | ```json !<tag:example.com,2000:app/int> "1 - 3" ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Named Handles

A *named tag handle* surrounds a non-empty name with "`!`" characters. A handle name must not be used in a [tag shorthand](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tag-shorthands) unless an explicit " `TAG` " directive has associated some prefix with it.

The name of the handle is a [presentation detail](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#presenting-the-serialization-tree) and must not be used to convey [content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) information. In particular, the YAML [processor](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#processes-and-models) need not preserve the handle name once [parsing](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#parsing-the-presentation-stream) is completed.

```
[92] c-named-tag-handle ::=
  c-tag            # '!'
  ns-word-char+
  c-tag            # '!'
```

**Example 6.20 Tag Handles**

| ``` %TAG !e! tag:example.com,2000:app/ --- !e!foo "bar" ``` | ```json !<tag:example.com,2000:app/foo> "bar" ``` |
| --- | --- |
