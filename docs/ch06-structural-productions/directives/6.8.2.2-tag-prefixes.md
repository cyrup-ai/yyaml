# 6.8.2.2. Tag Prefixes

There are two *tag prefix* variants:

```
[93] ns-tag-prefix ::=
  c-ns-local-tag-prefix | ns-global-tag-prefix
```

## Local Tag Prefix

If the prefix begins with a "`!`" character, [shorthands](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tag-shorthands) using the [handle](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tag-handles) are expanded to a [local tag](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tags). Note that such a [tag](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tags) is intentionally not a valid URI and its semantics are specific to the [application](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#processes-and-models). In particular, two [documents](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#documents) in the same [stream](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#streams) may assign different semantics to the same [local tag](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tags).

```
[94] c-ns-local-tag-prefix ::=
  c-tag           # '!'
  ns-uri-char*
```

**Example 6.21 Local Tag Prefix**

| ``` %TAG !m! !my- --- # Bulb here !m!light fluorescent ... %TAG !m! !my- --- # Color here !m!light green ``` | ```json !<!my-light> "fluorescent" --- !<!my-light> "green" ``` |
| --- | --- |

## Global Tag Prefix

If the prefix begins with a character other than "`!`", it must be a valid URI prefix, and should contain at least the scheme.[Shorthands](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tag-shorthands) using the associated [handle](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tag-handles) are expanded to globally unique URI tags and their semantics is consistent across [applications](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#processes-and-models). In particular, every [document](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#documents) in every [stream](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#streams) must assign the same semantics to the same [global tag](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tags).

```
[95] ns-global-tag-prefix ::=
  ns-tag-char
  ns-uri-char*
```

**Example 6.22 Global Tag Prefix**

| ``` %TAG !e! tag:example.com,2000:app/ --- - !e!foo "bar" ``` | ``` - !<tag:example.com,2000:app/foo> "bar" ``` |
| --- | --- |
