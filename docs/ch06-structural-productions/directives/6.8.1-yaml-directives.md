# 6.8.1. "YAML" Directives

The " `YAML` " directive specifies the version of YAML the [document](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#documents) conforms to. This specification defines version " `1.2` ", including recommendations for *YAML 1.1 processing*.

A version 1.2 YAML [processor](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#processes-and-models) must accept [documents](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#documents) with an explicit " `%YAML 1.2` " directive, as well as [documents](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#documents) lacking a " `YAML` " directive. Such [documents](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#documents) are assumed to conform to the 1.2 version specification.[Documents](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#documents) with a " `YAML` " directive specifying a higher minor version (e.g. " `%YAML 1.3` ") should be processed with an appropriate warning.[Documents](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#documents) with a " `YAML` " directive specifying a higher major version (e.g. " `%YAML 2.0` ") should be rejected with an appropriate error message.

A version 1.2 YAML [processor](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#processes-and-models) must also accept [documents](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#documents) with an explicit " `%YAML 1.1` " directive. Note that version 1.2 is mostly a superset of version 1.1, defined for the purpose of ensuring *JSON compatibility*. Hence a version 1.2 [processor](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#processes-and-models) should process version 1.1 [documents](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#documents) as if they were version 1.2, giving a warning on points of incompatibility (handling of [non-ASCII line breaks](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#line-break-characters), as described [above](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#line-break-characters)).

**Example 6.14 " `YAML` " directive**

| ``` %YAML 1.3 # Attempt parsing            # with a warning --- "foo" ``` | ```json "foo" ``` |
| --- | --- |

**Legend:**

- `[ns-yaml-directive](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#rule-ns-yaml-directive)`
- `[ns-yaml-version](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#rule-ns-yaml-version)`

It is an error to specify more than one " `YAML` " directive for the same document, even if both occurrences give the same version number.

**Example 6.15 Invalid Repeated YAML directive**

| ``` %YAML 1.2 %YAML 1.1 foo ``` | ``` ERROR: The YAML directive must only be given at most once per document. ``` |
