# 6.4. Empty Lines

An *empty line* line consists of the non- [content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) [prefix](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tag-prefixes) followed by a [line break](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#line-break-characters).

```
[70] l-empty(n,c) ::=
  (
      s-line-prefix(n,c)
    | s-indent-less-than(n)
  )
  b-as-line-feed
```

The semantics of empty lines depend on the [scalar style](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#node-styles) they appear in. This is handled on a case-by-case basis by the relevant productions.

**Example 6.5 Empty Lines**

| ``` Folding:   "Empty line ···→   as a line feed" Chomping: \|   Clipped empty lines · ``` | ```json { "Folding": "Empty line\nas a line feed",   "Chomping": "Clipped empty lines\n" } ``` |
| --- | --- | --- |
