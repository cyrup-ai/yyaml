# 6.3. Line Prefixes

Inside [scalar content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#scalar), each line begins with a non- [content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) *line prefix*. This prefix always includes the [indentation](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#indentation-spaces). For [flow scalar styles](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#flow-scalar-styles) it additionally includes all leading [white space](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#white-space-characters), which may contain [tab](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#white-space-characters) characters.

Line prefixes are a [presentation detail](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#presenting-the-serialization-tree) and must not be used to convey [content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) information.
