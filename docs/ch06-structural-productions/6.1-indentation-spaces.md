# 6.1. Indentation Spaces

In YAML [block styles](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#block-style-productions), structure is determined by *indentation*. In general, indentation is defined as a zero or more [space](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#white-space-characters) characters at the start of a line.

To maintain portability, [tab](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#white-space-characters) characters must not be used in indentation, since different systems treat [tabs](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#white-space-characters) differently. Note that most modern editors may be configured so that pressing the [tab](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#white-space-characters) key results in the insertion of an appropriate number of [spaces](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#white-space-characters).

The amount of indentation is a [presentation detail](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#presenting-the-serialization-tree) and must not be used to convey [content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) information.

```
[63]
s-indent(0) ::=
  <empty>

# When n≥0
s-indent(n+1) ::=
  s-space s-indent(n)
```

A [block style](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#block-style-productions) construct is terminated when encountering a line which is less indented than the construct. The productions use the notation " `s-indent-less-than(n)` " and " `s-indent-less-or-equal(n)` " to express this.

```
[64]
s-indent-less-than(1) ::=
  <empty>

# When n≥1
s-indent-less-than(n+1) ::=
  s-space s-indent-less-than(n)
  | <empty>
```
```
[65]
s-indent-less-or-equal(0) ::=
  <empty>

# When n≥0
s-indent-less-or-equal(n+1) ::=
  s-space s-indent-less-or-equal(n)
  | <empty>
```

Each [node](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) must be indented further than its parent [node](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes). All sibling [nodes](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) must use the exact same indentation level. However the [content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) of each sibling [node](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) may be further indented independently.

**Example 6.1 Indentation Spaces**

| ``` ··# Leading comment line spaces are ···# neither content nor indentation. ···· Not indented: ·By one space: \| ····By four ······spaces ·Flow style: [    # Leading spaces ···By two,        # in flow style ··Also by two,    # are neither ··→Still by two   # content nor ····]             # indentation. ``` | ```json { "Not indented": {     "By one space": "By four\n  spaces\n",     "Flow style": [       "By two",       "Also by two",       "Still by two" ] } } ``` |
| --- | --- | --- |

**Legend:**

- `[s-indent(n)](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#rule-s-indent)`
- `Content`
- `Neither content nor indentation`

The " `-` ", "`?`" and "`:`" characters used to denote [block collection](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#block-collection-styles) entries are perceived by people to be part of the indentation. This is handled on a case-by-case basis by the relevant productions.

**Example 6.2 Indentation Indicators**

| ``` ?·a :·-→b ··-··-→c ·····-·d ``` | ```json { "a":   [ "b",     [ "c",       "d" ] ] } ``` |
| --- | --- |
