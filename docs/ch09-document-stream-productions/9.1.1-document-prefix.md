# 9.1.1. Document Prefix

A document may be preceded by a *prefix* specifying the [character encoding](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#character-encodings) and optional [comment](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#comments) lines. Note that all [documents](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#documents) in a stream must use the same [character encoding](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#character-encodings). However it is valid to re-specify the [encoding](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#character-encodings) using a [byte order mark](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#character-encodings) for each [document](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#documents) in the stream.

The existence of the optional prefix does not necessarily indicate the existence of an actual [document](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#documents).

```
