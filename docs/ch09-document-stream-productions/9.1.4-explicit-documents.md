# 9.1.4. Explicit Documents

An *explicit document* begins with an explicit [directives end marker](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#document-markers) line but no [directives](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#directives). Since the existence of the [document](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#documents) is indicated by this [marker](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#document-markers), the [document](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#documents) itself may be [completely empty](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#example-empty-content).
