# 9.1.2. Document Markers

Using [directives](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#directives) creates a potential ambiguity. It is valid to have a " `%` " character at the start of a line (e.g. as the first character of the second line of a [plain scalar](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#plain-style)). How, then, to distinguish between an actual [directive](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#directives) and a [content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) line that happens to start with a " `%` " character?

The solution is the use of two special *marker* lines to control the processing of [directives](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#directives), one at the start of a [document](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#documents) and one at the end.

At the start of a [document](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#documents), lines beginning with a " `%` " character are assumed to be [directives](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#directives). The (possibly empty) list of [directives](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#directives) is terminated by a *directives end marker* line. Lines following this marker can safely use " `%` " as the first character.

At the end of a [document](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#documents), a *document end marker* line is used to signal the [parser](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#parsing-the-presentation-stream) to begin scanning for [directives](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#directives) again.

The existence of this optional *document suffix* does not necessarily indicate the existence of an actual following [document](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#documents).

Obviously, the actual [content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) lines are therefore forbidden to begin with either of these markers.

```
[203] c-directives-end ::= "---"
```
```
[204] c-document-end ::=
  "..."    # (not followed by non-ws char)
```
```
[205] l-document-suffix ::=
  c-document-end
  s-l-comments
```
```
[206] c-forbidden ::=
  <start-of-line>
  (
      c-directives-end
    | c-document-end
  )
  (
      b-char
    | s-white
    | <end-of-input>
  )
```
