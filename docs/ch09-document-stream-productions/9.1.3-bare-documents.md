# 9.1.3. Bare Documents

A *bare document* does not begin with any [directives](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#directives) or [marker](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#document-markers) lines. Such documents are very "clean" as they contain nothing other than the [content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes). In this case, the first non-comment line may not start with a " `%` " first character.

Document [nodes](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) are [indented](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#indentation-spaces) as if they have a parent [indented](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#indentation-spaces) at -1 [spaces](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#white-space-characters). Since a [node](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) must be more [indented](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#indentation-spaces) than its parent [node](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes), this allows the document's [node](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) to be [indented](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#indentation-spaces) at zero or more [spaces](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#white-space-characters).
