# 9.2. Streams

A YAML *stream* consists of zero or more [documents](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#documents). Subsequent [documents](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#documents) require some sort of separation [marker](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#document-markers) line. If a [document](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#documents) is not terminated by a [document end marker](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#document-markers) line, then the following [document](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#documents) must begin with a [directives end marker](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#document-markers) line.

```
[210] l-any-document ::=
    l-directive-document
  | l-explicit-document
  | l-bare-document
```
```
[211] l-yaml-stream ::=
  l-document-prefix*
  l-any-document?
  (
      (
        l-document-suffix+
        l-document-prefix*
        l-any-document?
      )
    | c-byte-order-mark
    | l-comment
    | l-explicit-document
  )*
```

**Example 9.6 Stream**

| ``` Document --- # Empty ... %YAML 1.2 --- matches %: 20 ``` | ```json "Document" --- null --- { "matches %": 20 } ``` |
| --- | --- |

**Legend:**

- `[l-any-document](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#rule-l-any-document)`
- `[l-document-suffix](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#rule-l-document-suffix)`
- `[l-explicit-document](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#rule-l-explicit-document)`

A sequence of bytes is a *well-formed stream* if, taken as a whole, it complies with the above `l-yaml-stream` production.
