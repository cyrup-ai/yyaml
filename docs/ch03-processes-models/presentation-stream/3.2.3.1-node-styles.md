# 3.2.3.1. Node Styles

Each [node](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) is presented in some *style*, depending on its [kind](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes). The node style is a [presentation detail](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#presenting-the-serialization-tree) and is not reflected in the [serialization tree](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#serialization-tree) or [representation graph](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representation-graph). There are two groups of styles. [Block styles](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#block-style-productions) use [indentation](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#indentation-spaces) to denote structure. In contrast, [flow styles](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#flow-style-productions) rely on explicit [indicators](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#indicator-characters).

YAML provides a rich set of *scalar styles*. [Block scalar](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#block-scalar-styles) styles include the [literal style](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#literal-style) and the [folded style](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#folded-style). [Flow scalar](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#flow-scalar-styles) styles include the [plain style](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#plain-style) and two quoted styles, the [single-quoted style](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#single-quoted-style) and the [double-quoted style](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#double-quoted-style). These styles offer a range of trade-offs between expressive power and readability.

Normally, [block sequences](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#block-sequences) and [mappings](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#mapping) begin on the next line. In some cases, YAML also allows nested [block](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#scalars) [collections](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#collections) to start in-line for a more [compact notation](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#example-flow-mapping-adjacent-values). In addition, YAML provides a [compact notation](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#example-flow-mapping-adjacent-values) for [flow mappings](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#flow-mappings) with a single [key/value pair](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#mapping), nested inside a [flow sequence](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#flow-sequences). These allow for a natural "ordered mapping" notation.
