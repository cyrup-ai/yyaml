# 3.2.3.2. Scalar Formats

YAML allows [scalars](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#scalars) to be [presented](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#presenting-the-serialization-tree) in several *formats*. For example, the integer "`11`" might also be written as "`0xB`". [Tags](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tags) must specify a mechanism for converting the formatted content to a [canonical form](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#canonical-form) for use in [equality](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#equality) testing. Like [node style](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#node-styles), the format is a [presentation detail](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#presenting-the-serialization-tree) and is not reflected in the [serialization tree](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#serialization-tree) and [representation graph](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representation-graph).

[Comments](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#comments) are a [presentation detail](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#presenting-the-serialization-tree) and must not have any effect on the [serialization tree](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#serialization-tree) or [representation graph](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representation-graph). In particular, comments are not associated with a particular [node](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes). The usual purpose of a comment is to communicate between the human maintainers of a file. A typical example is comments in a configuration file. Comments must not appear inside [scalars](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#scalars), but may be interleaved with such [scalars](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#scalars) inside [collections](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#collections).
