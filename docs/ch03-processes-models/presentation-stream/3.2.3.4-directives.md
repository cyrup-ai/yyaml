# 3.2.3.4. Directives

Each [document](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#documents) may be associated with a set of [directives](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#directives). A directive has a name and an optional sequence of parameters. Directives are instructions to the YAML [processor](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#processes-and-models) and like all other [presentation details](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#presenting-the-serialization-tree) are not reflected in the YAML [serialization tree](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#serialization-tree) or [representation graph](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representation-graph). This version of YAML defines two directives, "`YAML`" and "`TAG`". All other directives are [reserved](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#directives) for future versions of YAML.
