# 3.3.3. Recognized and Valid Tags

To be *valid*, a [node](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) must have a [tag](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tags) which is *recognized* by the YAML [processor](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#processes-and-models) and its [content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) must satisfy the constraints imposed by this [tag](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tags). If a [document](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#documents) contains a [scalar node](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) with an *unrecognized tag* or *invalid content*, only a [partial representation](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#loading-failure-points) may be [composed](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#composing-the-representation-graph). In contrast, a YAML [processor](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#processes-and-models) can always [compose](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#composing-the-representation-graph) a [complete representation](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#loading-failure-points) for an unrecognized or an invalid [collection](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#collections), since [collection](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#collections) [equality](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#equality) does not depend upon knowledge of the [collection's](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#mapping) data type. However, such a [complete representation](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#loading-failure-points) cannot be used to [construct](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#constructing-native-data-structures) a [native data structure](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representing-native-data-structures).
