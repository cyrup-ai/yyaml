# 3.3.4. Available Tags

In a given processing environment, there need not be an *available* native type corresponding to a given [tag](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tags). If a [node's tag](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tags) is *unavailable*, a YAML [processor](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#processes-and-models) will not be able to [construct](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#constructing-native-data-structures) a [native data structure](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representing-native-data-structures) for it. In this case, a [complete representation](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#loading-failure-points) may still be [composed](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#composing-the-representation-graph) and an [application](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#processes-and-models) may wish to use this [representation](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representation-graph) directly.
