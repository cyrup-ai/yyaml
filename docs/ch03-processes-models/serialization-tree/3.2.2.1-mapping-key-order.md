# 3.2.2.1. Mapping Key Order

In the [representation](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representation-graph) model, [mapping keys](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) do not have an order. To [serialize](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#serializing-the-representation-graph) a [mapping](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#mapping), it is necessary to impose an *ordering* on its [keys](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes). This order is a [serialization detail](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#serializing-the-representation-graph) and should not be used when [composing](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#composing-the-representation-graph) the [representation graph](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representation-graph) (and hence for the preservation of [application](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#processes-and-models) data). In every case where [node](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) order is significant, a [sequence](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#sequence) must be used. For example, an ordered [mapping](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#mapping) can be [represented](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representation-graph) as a [sequence](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#sequence) of [mappings](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#mapping), where each [mapping](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#mapping) is a single [key/value pair](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#mapping). YAML provides convenient [compact notation](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#example-flow-mapping-adjacent-values) for this case.
