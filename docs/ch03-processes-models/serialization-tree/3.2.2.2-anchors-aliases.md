# 3.2.2.2. Anchors and Aliases

In the [representation graph](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representation-graph), a [node](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) may appear in more than one [collection](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#collections). When [serializing](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#serializing-the-representation-graph) such data, the first occurrence of the [node](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) is *identified* by an *anchor*. Each subsequent occurrence is [serialized](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#serializing-the-representation-graph) as an [alias node](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#alias-nodes) which refers back to this anchor. Otherwise, anchor names are a [serialization detail](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#serializing-the-representation-graph) and are discarded once [composing](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#composing-the-representation-graph) is completed. When [composing](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#composing-the-representation-graph) a [representation graph](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representation-graph) from [serialized](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#serializing-the-representation-graph) events, an alias event refers to the most recent event in the [serialization](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#serialization-tree) having the specified anchor. Therefore, anchors need not be unique within a [serialization](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#serialization-tree). In addition, an anchor need not have an alias node referring to it.
