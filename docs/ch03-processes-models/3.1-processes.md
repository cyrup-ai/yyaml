# 3.1. Processes

Translating between [native data structures](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representing-native-data-structures) and a character [stream](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#streams) is done in several logically distinct stages, each with a well defined input and output data model, as shown in the following diagram:

A YAML processor need not expose the [serialization](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#serialization-tree) or [representation](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representation-graph) stages. It may translate directly between [native data structures](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representing-native-data-structures) and a character [stream](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#streams) ([dump](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#dump) and [load](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#load) in the diagram above). However, such a direct translation should take place so that the [native data structures](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representing-native-data-structures) are [constructed](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#constructing-native-data-structures) only from information available in the [representation](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representation-graph). In particular, [mapping key order](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#mapping), [comments](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#comments) and [tag handles](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tag-handles) should not be referenced during [construction](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#constructing-native-data-structures).
