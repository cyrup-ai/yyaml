# 3.3.1. Well-Formed Streams and Identified Aliases

A [well-formed](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#example-stream) character [stream](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#streams) must match the BNF productions specified in the following chapters. Successful loading also requires that each [alias](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#anchors-and-aliases) shall refer to a previous [node](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) [identified](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#anchors-and-aliases) by the [anchor](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#anchors-and-aliases). A YAML [processor](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#processes-and-models) should reject *ill-formed streams* and *unidentified aliases*. A YAML [processor](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#processes-and-models) may recover from syntax errors, possibly by ignoring certain parts of the input, but it must provide a mechanism for reporting such errors.
