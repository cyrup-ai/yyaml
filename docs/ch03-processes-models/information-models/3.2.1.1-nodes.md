# 3.2.1.1. Nodes

A YAML *node* [represents](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representation-graph) a single [native data structure](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representing-native-data-structures). Such nodes have *content* of one of three *kinds*: scalar, sequence or mapping. In addition, each node has a [tag](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tags) which serves to restrict the set of possible values the content can have.

## Scalar

The content of a *scalar* node is an opaque datum that can be [presented](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#presenting-the-serialization-tree) as a series of zero or more Unicode characters.

## Sequence

The content of a *sequence* node is an ordered series of zero or more nodes. In particular, a sequence may contain the same node more than once. It could even contain itself.

## Mapping

The content of a *mapping* node is an unordered set of *key/value* node *pairs*, with the restriction that each of the keys is [unique](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#node-comparison). YAML places no further restrictions on the nodes. In particular, keys may be arbitrary nodes, the same node may be used as the value of several key/value pairs and a mapping could even contain itself as a key or a value.
