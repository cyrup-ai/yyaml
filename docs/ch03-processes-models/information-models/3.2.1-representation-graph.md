# 3.2.1. Representation Graph

YAML's *representation* of [native data structure](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representing-native-data-structures) is a rooted, connected, directed graph of [tagged](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tags) [nodes](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes). By "directed graph" we mean a set of [nodes](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) and directed edges ("arrows"), where each edge connects one [node](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) to another (see a formal directed graph definition [^13]). All the [nodes](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) must be reachable from the *root node* via such edges. Note that the YAML graph may include cycles and a [node](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) may have more than one incoming edge.

[Nodes](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) that are defined in terms of other [nodes](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) are [collections](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#collections); [nodes](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) that are independent of any other [nodes](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) are [scalars](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#scalars). YAML supports two [kinds](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) of [collection nodes](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#mapping): [sequences](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#sequence) and [mappings](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#mapping). [Mapping nodes](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#mapping) are somewhat tricky because their [keys](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) are unordered and must be [unique](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#node-comparison).
