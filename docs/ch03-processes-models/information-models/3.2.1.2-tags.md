# 3.2.1.2. Tags

YAML [represents](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representation-graph) type information of [native data structures](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representing-native-data-structures) with a simple identifier, called a *tag*. *Global tags* are URIs and hence globally unique across all [applications](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#processes-and-models). The "`tag:`" URI scheme [^14] is recommended for all global YAML tags. In contrast, *local tags* are specific to a single [application](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#processes-and-models). Local tags start with "`!`", are not URIs and are not expected to be globally unique. YAML provides a "`TAG`" directive to make tag notation less verbose; it also offers easy migration from local to global tags. To ensure this, local tags are restricted to the URI character set and use URI character [escaping](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#escaped-characters).

YAML does not mandate any special relationship between different tags that begin with the same substring. Tags ending with URI fragments (containing "`#`") are no exception; tags that share the same base URI but differ in their fragment part are considered to be different, independent tags. By convention, fragments are used to identify different "variants" of a tag, while "`/`" is used to define nested tag "namespace" hierarchies. However, this is merely a convention and each tag may employ its own rules. For example, Perl tags may use "`::`" to express namespace hierarchies, Java tags may use "`.`", etc.

YAML tags are used to associate meta information with each [node](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes). In particular, each tag must specify the expected [node kind](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) ([scalar](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#scalar), [sequence](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#sequence) or [mapping](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#mapping)). [Scalar](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#scalar) tags must also provide a mechanism for converting [formatted content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#scalar-formats) to a [canonical form](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#canonical-form) for supporting [equality](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#equality) testing. Furthermore, a tag may provide additional information such as the set of allowed [content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) values for validation, a mechanism for [tag resolution](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tag-resolution) or any other data that is applicable to all of the tag's [nodes](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes).
