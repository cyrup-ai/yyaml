# 3.3. Loading Failure Points

The process of [loading](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#load) [native data structures](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representing-native-data-structures) from a YAML [stream](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#streams) has several potential *failure points*. The character [stream](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#streams) may be [ill-formed](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#well-formed-streams-and-identified-aliases), [aliases](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#anchors-and-aliases) may be [unidentified](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#well-formed-streams-and-identified-aliases), [unspecified tags](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#resolved-tags) may be [unresolvable](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#resolved-tags), [tags](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tags) may be [unrecognized](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#recognized-and-valid-tags), the [content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) may be [invalid](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#recognized-and-valid-tags), [mapping](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#mapping) [keys](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) may not be [unique](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#node-comparison) and a native type may be [unavailable](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#available-tags). Each of these failures results with an incomplete loading.

A *partial representation* need not [resolve](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#resolved-tags) the [tag](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tags) of each [node](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) and the [canonical form](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#canonical-form) of [formatted scalar content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#scalar-formats) need not be available. This weaker representation is useful for cases of incomplete knowledge of the types used in the [document](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#documents).

In contrast, a *complete representation* specifies the [tag](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tags) of each [node](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) and provides the [canonical form](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#canonical-form) of [formatted scalar content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#scalar-formats), allowing for [equality](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#equality) testing. A complete representation is required in order to [construct](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#constructing-native-data-structures) [native data structures](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representing-native-data-structures).
