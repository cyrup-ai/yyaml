# 3.1.2. Load

*Loading* [native data structures](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representing-native-data-structures) from a character [stream](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#streams) is done using the following three stages:

## Parsing the Presentation Stream

*Parsing* is the inverse process of [presentation](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#presentation-stream), it takes a [stream](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#streams) of characters and produces a [serialization tree](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#serialization-tree). Parsing discards all the [details](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#presenting-the-serialization-tree) introduced in the [presentation](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#presentation-stream) process, reporting only the [serialization tree](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#serialization-tree). Parsing can fail due to [ill-formed](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#well-formed-streams-and-identified-aliases) input.

## Composing the Representation Graph

*Composing* takes a [serialization tree](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#serialization-tree) and produces a [representation graph](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representation-graph). Composing discards all the [details](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#presenting-the-serialization-tree) introduced in the [serialization](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#serialization-tree) process, producing only the [representation graph](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representation-graph). Composing can fail due to any of several reasons, detailed [below](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#loading-failure-points).

## Constructing Native Data Structures

The final input process is *constructing* [native data structures](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representing-native-data-structures) from the YAML [representation](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representation-graph). Construction must be based only on the information available in the [representation](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representation-graph) and not on additional [serialization](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#serialization-tree) or [presentation details](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#presenting-the-serialization-tree) such as [comments](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#comments), [directives](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#directives), [mapping key order](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#mapping), [node styles](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#node-styles), [scalar content format](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#scalar-formats), [indentation](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#indentation-spaces) levels etc. Construction can fail due to the [unavailability](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#available-tags) of the required [native data types](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representing-native-data-structures).
