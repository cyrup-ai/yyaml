# 2.3. Scalars

[Scalar content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#scalar) can be written in [block](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#scalars) notation, using a [literal style](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#literal-style) (indicated by " `|` ") where all [line breaks](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#line-break-characters) are significant. Alternatively, they can be written with the [folded style](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#folded-style) (denoted by " `>` ") where each [line break](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#line-break-characters) is [folded](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#line-folding) to a [space](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#white-space-characters) unless it ends an [empty](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#empty-lines) or a [more-indented](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#example-more-indented-lines) line.

**Example 2.13 In literals, newlines are preserved**

```
# ASCII Art
--- |
  \//||\/||
  // ||  ||__
```

**Example 2.14 In the folded scalars, newlines become spaces**

```
--- >
  Mark McGwire's
  year was crippled
  by a knee injury.
```

**Example 2.16 Indentation determines scope**

```
name: Mark McGwire
accomplishment: >
  Mark set a major league
  home run record in 1998.
stats: |
  65 Home Runs
  0.278 Batting Average
```

YAML's [flow scalars](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#flow-scalar-styles) include the [plain style](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#plain-style) (most examples thus far) and two quoted styles. The [double-quoted style](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#double-quoted-style) provides [escape sequences](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#escaped-characters). The [single-quoted style](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#single-quoted-style) is useful when [escaping](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#escaped-characters) is not needed. All [flow scalars](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#flow-scalar-styles) can span multiple lines; [line breaks](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#line-break-characters) are always [folded](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#line-folding).

**Example 2.17 Quoted Scalars**

```
unicode: "Sosa did fine.\u263A"
control: "\b1998\t1999\t2000\n"
hex esc: "\x0d\x0a is \r\n"

single: '"Howdy!" he cried.'
quoted: ' # Not a ''comment''.'
tie-fighter: '|\-*-/|'
```

**Example 2.18 Multi-line Flow Scalars**

```
plain:
  This unquoted scalar
  spans many lines.

quoted: "So does this
  quoted scalar.\n"
```
