# 2.2. Structures

YAML uses three dashes (" `---` ") to separate [directives](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#directives) from [document](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#documents) [content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes). This also serves to signal the start of a document if no [directives](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#directives) are present. Three dots ( "`...`") indicate the end of a document without starting a new one, for use in communication channels.

**Example 2.7 Two Documents in a Stream (each with a leading comment)**

```
# Ranking of 1998 home runs
---
- Mark McGwire
- Sammy Sosa
- Ken Griffey

# Team ranking
---
- Chicago Cubs
- St Louis Cardinals
```

**Example 2.8 Play by Play Feed from a Game**

```
---
time: 20:03:20
player: Sammy Sosa
action: strike (miss)
...
---
time: 20:03:47
player: Sammy Sosa
action: grand slam
...
```

Repeated [nodes](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) (objects) are first [identified](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#anchors-and-aliases) by an [anchor](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#anchors-and-aliases) (marked with the ampersand - " `&` ") and are then [aliased](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#anchors-and-aliases) (referenced with an asterisk - " `*` ") thereafter.

**Example 2.10 Node for " `Sammy Sosa` " appears twice in this document**

```
---
hr:
- Mark McGwire
# Following node labeled SS
- &SS Sammy Sosa
rbi:
- *SS # Subsequent occurrence
- Ken Griffey
```

A question mark and space ("`? `") indicate a complex [mapping](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#mapping) [key](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes). Within a [block collection](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#block-collection-styles), [key/value pairs](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#mapping) can start immediately following the [dash](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#block-sequences), [colon](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#flow-mappings) or [question mark](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#flow-mappings).

**Example 2.11 Mapping between Sequences**

```
? - Detroit Tigers
  - Chicago cubs
: - 2001-07-23

? [ New York Yankees,
    Atlanta Braves ]
: [ 2001-07-02, 2001-08-12,
    2001-08-14 ]
```

**Example 2.12 Compact Nested Mapping**
