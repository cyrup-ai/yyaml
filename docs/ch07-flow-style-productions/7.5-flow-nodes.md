# 7.5. Flow Nodes

*JSON-like* [flow styles](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#flow-style-productions) all have explicit start and end [indicators](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#indicator-characters). The only [flow style](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#flow-style-productions) that does not have this property is the [plain scalar](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#plain-style). Note that none of the "JSON-like" styles is actually acceptable by JSON. Even the [double-quoted style](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#double-quoted-style) is a superset of the JSON string format.

**Example 7.21 Single Pair Implicit Entries**

| ``` - [ YAML·: separate ] - [ °: empty key entry ] - [ {JSON: like}:adjacent ] ``` | ```json [ [ { "YAML": "separate" } ],   [ { null: "empty key entry" } ],   [ { { "JSON": "like" }: "adjacent" } ] ] ``` |

- `Value`

**Example 7.22 Invalid Implicit Keys**

| ``` [ foo  bar: invalid,  "foo_...>1K characters..._bar": invalid ] ``` | ``` ERROR: - The foo bar key spans multiple lines - The foo...bar key is too long ``` |

**Example 7.23 Flow Content**

| ``` - [ a, b ] - { a: b } - "a" - 'b' - c ``` | ```json [ [ "a", "b" ],   { "a": "b" },   "a",   "b",   "c" ] ``` |

A complete [flow](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#flow-style-productions) [node](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) also has optional [node properties](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#node-properties), except for [alias nodes](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#alias-nodes) which refer to the [anchored](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#anchors-and-aliases) [node properties](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#node-properties).
