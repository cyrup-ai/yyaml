# 7.1. Alias Nodes

Subsequent occurrences of a previously [serialized](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#serializing-the-representation-graph) node are [presented](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#presenting-the-serialization-tree) as *alias nodes*. The first occurrence of the [node](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) must be marked by an [anchor](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#anchors-and-aliases) to allow subsequent occurrences to be [presented](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#presenting-the-serialization-tree) as alias nodes.

An alias node is denoted by the " `*` " indicator. The alias refers to the most recent preceding [node](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) having the same [anchor](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#anchors-and-aliases). It is an error for an alias node to use an [anchor](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#anchors-and-aliases) that does not previously occur in the [document](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#documents). It is not an error to specify an [anchor](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#anchors-and-aliases) that is not used by any alias node.

Note that an alias node must not specify any [properties](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#node-properties) or [content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes), as these were already specified at the first occurrence of the [node](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes).
