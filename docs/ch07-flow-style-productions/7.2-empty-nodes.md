# 7.2. Empty Nodes

YAML allows the [node content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) to be omitted in many cases.[Nodes](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) with empty [content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) are interpreted as if they were [plain scalars](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#plain-style) with an empty value. Such [nodes](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) are commonly resolved to a " `null` " value.

```
[105] e-scalar ::= ""
```

In the examples, empty [scalars](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#scalars) are sometimes displayed as the glyph " `°` " for clarity. Note that this glyph corresponds to a position in the characters [stream](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#streams) rather than to an actual character.

**Example 7.2 Empty Content**

| ``` {   foo : !!str°,   !!str° : bar, } ``` | ```json { "foo": "",   "": "bar" } ``` |
| --- | --- |

**Legend:**

- `[e-scalar](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#rule-e-scalar)`

Both the [node's properties](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#node-properties) and [node content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) are optional. This allows for a *completely empty node*. Completely empty nodes are only valid when following some explicit indication for their existence.

```
[106] e-node ::=
  e-scalar    # ""
```

**Example 7.3 Completely Empty Flow Nodes**

| ``` {   ? foo :°,   °: bar, } ``` | ```json { "foo": null,   null : "bar" } ``` |
| --- | --- |

**Legend:**

- `[e-node](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#rule-e-node)`
