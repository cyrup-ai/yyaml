# 7.4. Flow Collection Styles

A *flow collection* may be nested within a [block collection](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#block-collection-styles) (\[`FLOW-OUT` context\]), nested within another flow collection (\[`FLOW-IN` context\]) or be a part of an [implicit key](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#example-single-pair-explicit-entry) (\[`FLOW-KEY` context\] or \[`BLOCK-KEY` context\]). Flow collection entries are terminated by the "`,`" indicator. The final "`,`" may be omitted. This does not cause ambiguity because flow collection entries can never be [completely empty](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#example-empty-content).

in-flow(n,FLOW-OUT)  ::= ns-s-flow-seq-entries(n,FLOW-IN)
in-flow(n,FLOW-IN)   ::= ns-s-flow-seq-entries(n,FLOW-IN)
in-flow(n,BLOCK-KEY) ::= ns-s-flow-seq-entries(n,FLOW-KEY)
in-flow(n,FLOW-KEY)  ::= ns-s-flow-seq-entries(n,FLOW-KEY)
```
