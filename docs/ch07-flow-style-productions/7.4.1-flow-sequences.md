# 7.4.1. Flow Sequences

*Flow sequence content* is denoted by surrounding " `[`" and "`]` " characters.

```
[137] c-flow-sequence(n,c) ::=
  c-sequence-start    # '['
  s-separate(n,c)?
  in-flow(n,c)?
  c-sequence-end      # ']'
```

Sequence entries are separated by a "`,`" character.

```
[138] ns-s-flow-seq-entries(n,c) ::=
  ns-flow-seq-entry(n,c)
  s-separate(n,c)?
  (
    c-collect-entry     # ','
    s-separate(n,c)?
    ns-s-flow-seq-entries(n,c)?
  )?
```

**Example 7.13 Flow Sequence**

| ``` - [ one, two, ] - [three ,four] ``` | ```json [ [ "one",     "two" ],   [ "three",     "four" ] ] ``` |
| --- | --- |

**Legend:**

- `[c-sequence-start](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#rule-c-sequence-start) [c-sequence-end](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#rule-c-sequence-end)`
- `[ns-flow-seq-entry(n,c)](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#rule-ns-flow-seq-entry)`

Any [flow node](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#flow-nodes) may be used as a flow sequence entry. In addition, YAML provides a [compact notation](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#example-flow-mapping-adjacent-values) for the case where a flow sequence entry is a [mapping](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#mapping) with a [single key/value pair](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#mapping).

```
[139] ns-flow-seq-entry(n,c) ::=
  ns-flow-pair(n,c) | ns-flow-node(n,c)
```

**Example 7.14 Flow Sequence Entries**

| ``` [ "double  quoted", 'single            quoted', plain  text, [ nested ], single: pair, ] ``` | ```json [ "double quoted",   "single quoted",   "plain text",   [ "nested" ],   { "single": "pair" } ] ``` |
| --- | --- |

**Legend:**

- `[ns-flow-node(n,c)](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#rule-ns-flow-node)`
- `[ns-flow-pair(n,c)](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#rule-ns-flow-pair)`
