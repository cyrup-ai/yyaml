# 7.3. Flow Scalar Styles

YAML provides three *flow scalar styles*: [double-quoted](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#double-quoted-style), [single-quoted](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#single-quoted-style) and [plain](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#plain-style) (unquoted). Each provides a different trade-off between readability and expressive power.

The [scalar style](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#node-styles) is a [presentation detail](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#presenting-the-serialization-tree) and must not be used to convey [content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) information, with the exception that [plain scalars](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#plain-style) are distinguished for the purpose of [tag resolution](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tag-resolution).
