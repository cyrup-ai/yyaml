# 7.3.3. Plain Style

The *plain* (unquoted) style has no identifying [indicators](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#indicator-characters) and provides no form of escaping. It is therefore the most readable, most limited and most [context](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#context-c) sensitive [style](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#node-styles). In addition to a restricted character set, a plain scalar must not be empty or contain leading or trailing [white space](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#white-space-characters) characters. It is only possible to break a long plain line where a [space](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#white-space-characters) character is surrounded by non- [spaces](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#white-space-characters).

Plain scalars must not begin with most [indicators](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#indicator-characters), as this would cause ambiguity with other YAML constructs. However, the "`:`", "`?`" and " `-` " [indicators](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#indicator-characters) may be used as the first character if followed by a non- [space](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#white-space-characters) "safe" character, as this causes no ambiguity.

```
[126] ns-plain-first(c) ::=
    (
        ns-char
      - c-indicator
    )
  | (
      (
          c-mapping-key       # '?'
        | c-mapping-value     # ':'
        | c-sequence-entry    # '-'
      )
      [ lookahead = ns-plain-safe(c) ]
    )
```

Plain scalars must never contain the "`: `" and " ` #` " character combinations. Such combinations would cause ambiguity with [mapping](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#mapping) [key/value pairs](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#mapping) and [comments](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#comments). In addition, inside [flow collections](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#flow-collection-styles), or when used as [implicit keys](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#example-single-pair-explicit-entry), plain scalars must not contain the " `[`", "`]` ", " `{` ", " `}` " and "`,`" characters. These characters would cause ambiguity with [flow collection](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#flow-collection-styles) structures.

```
[127]
ns-plain-safe(FLOW-OUT)  ::= ns-plain-safe-out
ns-plain-safe(FLOW-IN)   ::= ns-plain-safe-in
ns-plain-safe(BLOCK-KEY) ::= ns-plain-safe-out
ns-plain-safe(FLOW-KEY)  ::= ns-plain-safe-in
```
```
[128] ns-plain-safe-out ::=
  ns-char
```
```
[129] ns-plain-safe-in ::=
  ns-char - c-flow-indicator
```
```
[130] ns-plain-char(c) ::=
    (
        ns-plain-safe(c)
      - c-mapping-value    # ':'
      - c-comment          # '#'
    )
  | (
      [ lookbehind = ns-char ]
      c-comment          # '#'
    )
  | (
      c-mapping-value    # ':'
      [ lookahead = ns-plain-safe(c) ]
    )
```

**Example 7.10 Plain Characters**

| ``` # Outside flow collection: - ::vector - ": - ()" - Up, up, and away! - -123 - https://example.com/foo#bar # Inside flow collection: - [ ::vector,   ": - ()",   "Up, up and away!",   -123,   https://example.com/foo#bar ] ``` | ```json [ "::vector",   ": - ()",   "Up, up, and away!",   -123,   "http://example.com/foo#bar",   [ "::vector",     ": - ()",     "Up, up, and away!",     -123,     "http://example.com/foo#bar" ] ] ``` |

**Legend:**

- `[ns-plain-first(c)](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#rule-ns-plain-first)`
- `[ns-plain-char(c)](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#rule-ns-plain-char)`
- `Not ns-plain-first(c)`
- `Not ns-plain-char(c)`

Plain scalars are further restricted to a single line when contained inside an [implicit key](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#example-single-pair-explicit-entry).

```
[131]
ns-plain(n,FLOW-OUT)  ::= ns-plain-multi-line(n,FLOW-OUT)
ns-plain(n,FLOW-IN)   ::= ns-plain-multi-line(n,FLOW-IN)
ns-plain(n,BLOCK-KEY) ::= ns-plain-one-line(BLOCK-KEY)
ns-plain(n,FLOW-KEY)  ::= ns-plain-one-line(FLOW-KEY)
```
```
[132] nb-ns-plain-in-line(c) ::=
  (
    s-white*
    ns-plain-char(c)
  )*
```
```
[133] ns-plain-one-line(c) ::=
  ns-plain-first(c)
  nb-ns-plain-in-line(c)
```

**Example 7.11 Plain Implicit Keys**

| ``` implicit block key : [   implicit flow key : value,  ] ``` | ```json { "implicit block key":   [ { "implicit flow key": "value" } ] } ``` |
| --- | --- |

**Legend:**

- `[ns-plain-one-line(c)](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#rule-ns-plain-one-line)`

All leading and trailing [white space](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#white-space-characters) characters are excluded from the [content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes). Each continuation line must therefore contain at least one non- [space](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#white-space-characters) character. Empty lines, if any, are consumed as part of the [line folding](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#line-folding).

```
[134] s-ns-plain-next-line(n,c) ::=
  s-flow-folded(n)
  ns-plain-char(c)
  nb-ns-plain-in-line(c)
```
```
[135] ns-plain-multi-line(n,c) ::=
  ns-plain-one-line(c)
  s-ns-plain-next-line(n,c)*
```
