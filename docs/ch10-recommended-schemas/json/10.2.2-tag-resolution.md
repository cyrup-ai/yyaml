# 10.2.2. Tag Resolution

The [JSON schema](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#json-schema) [tag resolution](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tag-resolution) is an extension of the [failsafe schema](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#failsafe-schema) [tag resolution](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tag-resolution).

All [nodes](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) with the "`!`" non-specific tag are [resolved](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#resolved-tags), by the standard [convention](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#resolved-tags), to " `tag:yaml.org,2002:seq` ", " `tag:yaml.org,2002:map` " or " `tag:yaml.org,2002:str` ", according to their [kind](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes).

[Collections](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#collections) with the "`?`" non-specific tag (that is, [untagged](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#resolved-tags) [collections](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#collections)) are [resolved](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#resolved-tags) to " `tag:yaml.org,2002:seq` " or " `tag:yaml.org,2002:map` " according to their [kind](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes).

[Scalars](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#scalars) with the "`?`" non-specific tag (that is, [plain scalars](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#plain-style)) are matched with a list of regular expressions (first match wins, e.g. `0` is resolved as `!!int`). In principle, JSON files should not contain any [scalars](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#scalars) that do not match at least one of these. Hence the YAML [processor](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#processes-and-models) should consider them to be an error.

| Regular expression | Resolved to tag |
| --- | --- |
| `null` | tag:yaml.org,2002:null |
| `true \| false` | tag:yaml.org,2002:bool |
| `-? ( 0 \| [1-9] [0-9]* )` | tag:yaml.org,2002:int |
| `-? ( 0 \| [1-9] [0-9]* ) ( \. [0-9]* )? ( [eE] [-+]? [0-9]+ )?` | tag:yaml.org,2002:float |
| `*` | Error |

> Note: The regular expression for `float` does not exactly match the one in the JSON specification, where at least one digit is required after the dot: `( \.  [0-9]+ )`. The YAML 1.2 specification intended to match JSON behavior, but this cannot be addressed in the 1.2.2 specification.

**Example 10.8 JSON Tag Resolution**

| ``` A null: null Booleans: [ true, false ] Integers: [ 0, -0, 3, -19 ] Floats: [ 0., -0.0, 12e03, -2E+05 ] Invalid: [ True, Null,   0o7, 0x3A, +12.3 ] ``` | ```json { "A null": null,   "Booleans": [ true, false ],   "Integers": [ 0, 0, 3, -19 ],   "Floats": [ 0.0, -0.0, 12000, -200000 ],   "Invalid": [ "True", "Null",     "0o7", "0x3A", "+12.3" ] } ``` |
