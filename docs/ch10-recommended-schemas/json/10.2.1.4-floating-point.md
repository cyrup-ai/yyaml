# 10.2.1.4. Floating Point

**URI**

`tag:yaml.org,2002:float`

**Kind**

[Scalar](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#scalar).

**Definition**

[Represents](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representation-graph) an approximation to real numbers, including three special values (positive and negative infinity and "not a number").

Some languages (such as Perl) provide only a "number" type that allows for both integer and floating-point values. A YAML [processor](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#processes-and-models) may use such a type for floating-point numbers, as long as they round-trip properly.

Not all floating-point values can be stored exactly in any given [native](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representing-native-data-structures) type. Hence a float value may change by "a small amount" when round-tripped. The supported range and accuracy depends on the implementation, though 32 bit IEEE floats should be safe. Since YAML does not specify a particular accuracy, using floating-point [mapping keys](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) requires great care and is not recommended.

**Canonical Form**

Either `0`, `.inf`, `-.inf`, `.nan` or scientific notation matching the regular expression  
`-? [1-9] ( \. [0-9]* [1-9] )? ( e [-+] [1-9] [0-9]* )?`.

**Example 10.7 `!!float` Examples**

```
negative: !!float -1
zero: !!float 0
positive: !!float 2.3e4
infinity: !!float .inf
not a number: !!float .nan
```
