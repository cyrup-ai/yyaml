# 10.2.1.1. Null

**URI**

`tag:yaml.org,2002:null`

**Kind**

[Scalar](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#scalar).

**Definition**

[Represents](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representation-graph) the lack of a value. This is typically [bound](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representing-native-data-structures) to a [native](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representing-native-data-structures) null-like value (e.g., `undef` in Perl,`None` in Python). Note that a null is different from an empty string. Also, a [mapping](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#mapping) entry with some [key](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) and a null [value](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) is valid and different from not having that [key](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) in the [mapping](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#mapping).

**Canonical Form**

`null`.

**Example 10.4 `!!null` Examples**

```
!!null null: value for null key
key with null value: !!null null
```
