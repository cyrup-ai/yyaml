# 10.2.1.3. Integer

**URI**

`tag:yaml.org,2002:int`

**Kind**

[Scalar](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#scalar).

**Definition**

[Represents](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representation-graph) arbitrary sized finite mathematical integers. Scalars of this type should be [bound](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representing-native-data-structures) to a [native](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representing-native-data-structures) integer data type, if possible.

Some languages (such as Perl) provide only a "number" type that allows for both integer and floating-point values. A YAML [processor](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#processes-and-models) may use such a type for integers as long as they round-trip properly.

In some languages (such as C), an integer may overflow the [native](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representing-native-data-structures) type's storage capability. A YAML [processor](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#processes-and-models) may reject such a value as an error, truncate it with a warning or find some other manner to round-trip it. In general, integers representable using 32 binary digits should safely round-trip through most systems.

**Canonical Form**

Decimal integer notation, with a leading " `-` " character for negative values, matching the regular expression `0 | -? [1-9] [0-9]*`

**Example 10.6 `!!int` Examples**

```
negative: !!int -12
zero: !!int 0
positive: !!int 34
