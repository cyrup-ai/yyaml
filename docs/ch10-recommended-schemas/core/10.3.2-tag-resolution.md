# 10.3.2. Tag Resolution

The [core schema](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#core-schema) [tag resolution](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tag-resolution) is an extension of the [JSON schema](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#json-schema) [tag resolution](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tag-resolution).

All [nodes](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) with the "`!`" non-specific tag are [resolved](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#resolved-tags), by the standard [convention](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#resolved-tags), to " `tag:yaml.org,2002:seq` ", " `tag:yaml.org,2002:map` " or " `tag:yaml.org,2002:str` ", according to their [kind](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes).

[Collections](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#collections) with the "`?`" non-specific tag (that is, [untagged](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#resolved-tags) [collections](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#collections)) are [resolved](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#resolved-tags) to " `tag:yaml.org,2002:seq` " or " `tag:yaml.org,2002:map` " according to their [kind](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes).

[Scalars](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#scalars) with the "`?`" non-specific tag (that is, [plain scalars](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#plain-style)) are matched with an extended list of regular expressions. However, in this case, if none of the regular expressions matches, the [scalar](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#scalar) is [resolved](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#resolved-tags) to `tag:yaml.org,2002:str` (that is, considered to be a string).

| Regular expression | Resolved to tag |
| --- | --- |
| `null \| Null \| NULL \| ~` | tag:yaml.org,2002:null |
| `/* Empty */` | tag:yaml.org,2002:null |
| `true \| True \| TRUE \| false \| False \| FALSE` | tag:yaml.org,2002:bool |
| `[-+]? [0-9]+` | tag:yaml.org,2002:int (Base 10) |
| `0o [0-7]+` | tag:yaml.org,2002:int (Base 8) |
| `0x [0-9a-fA-F]+` | tag:yaml.org,2002:int (Base 16) |
| `[-+]? ( \. [0-9]+ \| [0-9]+ ( \. [0-9]* )? ) ( [eE] [-+]? [0-9]+ )?` | tag:yaml.org,2002:float (Number) |
| `[-+]? ( \.inf \| \.Inf \| \.INF )` | tag:yaml.org,2002:float (Infinity) |
| `\.nan \| \.NaN \| \.NAN` | tag:yaml.org,2002:float (Not a number) |
| `*` | tag:yaml.org,2002:str (Default) |

**Example 10.9 Core Tag Resolution**

| ``` A null: null Also a null: # Empty Not a null: "" Booleans: [ true, True, false, FALSE ] Integers: [ 0, 0o7, 0x3A, -19 ] Floats: [   0., -0.0, .5, +12e03, -2E+05 ] Also floats: [   .inf, -.Inf, +.INF, .NAN ] ``` | ```json { "A null": null,   "Also a null": null,   "Not a null": "",   "Booleans": [ true, true, false, false ],   "Integers": [ 0, 7, 58, -19 ],   "Floats": [     0.0, -0.0, 0.5, 12000, -200000 ],   "Also floats": [     Infinity, -Infinity, Infinity, NaN ] } ``` |
