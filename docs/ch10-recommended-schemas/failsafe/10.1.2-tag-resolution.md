# 10.1.2. Tag Resolution

All [nodes](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) with the "`!`" non-specific tag are [resolved](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#resolved-tags), by the standard [convention](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#resolved-tags), to " `tag:yaml.org,2002:seq` ", " `tag:yaml.org,2002:map` " or " `tag:yaml.org,2002:str` ", according to their [kind](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes).

All [nodes](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) with the "`?`" non-specific tag are left [unresolved](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#resolved-tags). This constrains the [application](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#processes-and-models) to deal with a [partial representation](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#loading-failure-points).
