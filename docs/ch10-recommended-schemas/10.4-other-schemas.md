# 10.4. Other Schemas

None of the above recommended [schemas](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#recommended-schemas) preclude the use of arbitrary explicit [tags](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tags). Hence YAML [processors](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#processes-and-models) for a particular programming language typically provide some form of [local tags](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tags) that map directly to the language's [native data structures](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representing-native-data-structures) (e.g., `!ruby/object:Set`).

While such [local tags](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tags) are useful for ad hoc [applications](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#processes-and-models), they do not suffice for stable, interoperable cross- [application](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#processes-and-models) or cross-platform data exchange.

Interoperable [schemas](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#recommended-schemas) make use of [global tags](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tags) (URIs) that [represent](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representation-graph) the same data across different programming languages. In addition, an interoperable [schema](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#recommended-schemas) may provide additional [tag resolution](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tag-resolution) rules. Such rules may provide additional regular expressions, as well as consider the path to the [node](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes). This allows interoperable [schemas](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#recommended-schemas) to use [untagged](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#resolved-tags) [nodes](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes).

It is strongly recommended that such [schemas](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#recommended-schemas) be based on the [core schema](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#core-schema) defined above.
