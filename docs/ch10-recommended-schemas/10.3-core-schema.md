# 10.3. Core Schema

The *Core schema* is an extension of the [JSON schema](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#json-schema), allowing for more human-readable [presentation](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#presentation-stream) of the same types. This is the recommended default [schema](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#recommended-schemas) that YAML [processor](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#processes-and-models) should use unless instructed otherwise. It is also strongly recommended that other [schemas](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#recommended-schemas) should be based on it.
