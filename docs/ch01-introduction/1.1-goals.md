# 1.1. Goals

The design goals for YAML are, in decreasing priority:

1. YAML should be easily readable by humans.
2. YAML data should be portable between programming languages.
3. YAML should match the [native data structures](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representing-native-data-structures) of dynamic languages.
4. YAML should have a consistent model to support generic tools.
5. YAML should support one-pass processing.
6. YAML should be expressive and extensible.
7. YAML should be easy to implement and use.
