# 5.6. Miscellaneous Characters

The YAML syntax productions make use of the following additional character classes:

A decimal digit for numbers:

```
[35] ns-dec-digit ::=
  [x30-x39]             # 0-9
```

A hexadecimal digit for [escape sequences](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#escaped-characters):

```
[36] ns-hex-digit ::=
    ns-dec-digit        # 0-9
  | [x41-x46]           # A-F
  | [x61-x66]           # a-f
```

ASCII letter (alphabetic) characters:

```
[37] ns-ascii-letter ::=
    [x41-x5A]           # A-Z
  | [x61-x7A]           # a-z
```

Word (alphanumeric) characters for identifiers:

```
[38] ns-word-char ::=
    ns-dec-digit        # 0-9
  | ns-ascii-letter     # A-Z a-z
  | '-'                 # '-'
```

URI characters for [tags](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tags), as defined in the URI specification [^18].

By convention, any URI characters other than the allowed printable ASCII characters are first *encoded* in UTF-8 and then each byte is *escaped* using the " `%` " character. The YAML [processor](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#processes-and-models) must not expand such escaped characters.[Tag](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tags) characters must be preserved and compared exactly as [presented](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#presenting-the-serialization-tree) in the YAML [stream](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#streams), without any processing.

```
[39] ns-uri-char ::=
    (
      '%'
      ns-hex-digit{2}
    )
  | ns-word-char
  | '#'
  | ';'
  | '/'
  | '?'
  | ':'
  | '@'
  | '&'
  | '='
  | '+'
  | '$'
  | ','
  | '_'
  | '.'
  | '!'
  | '~'
  | '*'
  | "'"
  | '('
  | ')'
  | '['
  | ']'
```

The "`!`" character is used to indicate the end of a [named tag handle](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tag-handles); hence its use in [tag shorthands](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tag-shorthands) is restricted. In addition, such [shorthands](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tag-shorthands) must not contain the " `[`", "`]` ", " `{` ", " `}` " and "`,`" characters. These characters would cause ambiguity with [flow collection](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#flow-collection-styles) structures.

```
[40] ns-tag-char ::=
    ns-uri-char
  - c-tag               # '!'
  - c-flow-indicator
```
