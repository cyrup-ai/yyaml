# 5.5. White Space Characters

YAML recognizes two *white space* characters: *space* and *tab*.

```
[31] s-space ::= x20
```
```
[32] s-tab ::= x09
```
```
[33] s-white ::=
  s-space | s-tab
```

The rest of the ([printable](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#character-set)) non- [break](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#line-break-characters) characters are considered to be non-space characters.

```
[34] ns-char ::=
  nb-char - s-white
```

In the examples, tab characters are displayed as the glyph " `→` ". Space characters are sometimes displayed as the glyph " `·` " for clarity.
