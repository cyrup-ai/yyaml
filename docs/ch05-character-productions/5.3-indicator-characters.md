# 5.3. Indicator Characters

*Indicators* are characters that have special semantics.

" `-` " (`x2D`, hyphen) denotes a [block sequence](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#block-sequences) entry.

```
[4] c-sequence-entry ::= '-'
```

"`?`" (`x3F`, question mark) denotes a [mapping key](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes).

```
[5] c-mapping-key ::= '?'
```

"`:`" (`x3A`, colon) denotes a [mapping value](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#mapping).

```
[6] c-mapping-value ::= ':'
```

**Example 5.3 Block Structure Indicators**

| ``` sequence: - one - two mapping:   ? sky   : blue   sea : green ``` | ```json { "sequence": [     "one",     "two" ],   "mapping": {     "sky": "blue",     "sea": "green" } } ``` |
| --- | --- |

**Legend:**

- `[c-sequence-entry](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#rule-c-sequence-entry)`
- `[c-mapping-key](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#rule-c-mapping-key)`
- `[c-mapping-value](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#rule-c-mapping-value)`

"`,`" (`x2C`, comma) ends a [flow collection](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#flow-collection-styles) entry.

```
[7] c-collect-entry ::= ','
```

" `[`" (`x5B`, left bracket) starts a [flow sequence](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#flow-sequences).

```
[8] c-sequence-start ::= '['
```

"`]` " (`x5D`, right bracket) ends a [flow sequence](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#flow-sequences).

```
[9] c-sequence-end ::= ']'
```

" `{` " (`x7B`, left brace) starts a [flow mapping](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#flow-mappings).

```
[10] c-mapping-start ::= '{'
```

" `}` " (`x7D`, right brace) ends a [flow mapping](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#flow-mappings).

```
[11] c-mapping-end ::= '}'
```

**Example 5.4 Flow Collection Indicators**

| ``` sequence: [ one, two, ] mapping: { sky: blue, sea: green } ``` | ```json { "sequence": [ "one", "two" ],   "mapping":     { "sky": "blue", "sea": "green" } } ``` |
| --- | --- |

" `#` " (`x23`, octothorpe, hash, sharp, pound, number sign) denotes a [comment](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#comments).

```
[12] c-comment ::= '#'
```

" `&` " (`x26`, ampersand) denotes a [node's anchor property](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#anchors-and-aliases).

```
[13] c-anchor ::= '&'
```

" `*` " (`x2A`, asterisk) denotes an [alias node](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#alias-nodes).

```
[14] c-alias ::= '*'
```

The "`!`" (`x21`, exclamation) is used for specifying [node tags](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#node-tags). It is used to denote [tag handles](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tag-handles) used in [tag directives](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tag-directives) and [tag properties](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#node-tags); to denote [local tags](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tags); and as the [non-specific tag](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#resolved-tags) for non- [plain scalars](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#plain-style).

```
[15] c-tag ::= '!'
```

**Example 5.6 Node Property Indicators**

| ``` anchored: !local &anchor value alias: *anchor ``` | ```json { "anchored": !local &A1 "value",   "alias": *A1 } ``` |
| --- | --- |

**Legend:**

- `[c-tag](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#rule-c-tag)`
- `[c-anchor](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#rule-c-anchor)`
- `[c-alias](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#rule-c-alias)`

" `|` " (`7C`, vertical bar) denotes a [literal block scalar](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#literal-style).

```
[16] c-literal ::= '|'
```

" `>` " (`x3E`, greater than) denotes a [folded block scalar](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#block-folding).

```
[17] c-folded ::= '>'
```

**Example 5.7 Block Scalar Indicators**

| ``` literal: \|   some   text folded: >   some   text ``` | ```json { "literal": "some\ntext\n",   "folded": "some text\n" } ``` |
| --- | --- | --- |

**Legend:**

- `[c-literal](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#rule-c-literal)`
- `[c-folded](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#rule-c-folded)`

" `'` " (`x27`, apostrophe, single quote) surrounds a [single-quoted flow scalar](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#single-quoted-style).

```
[18] c-single-quote ::= "'"
```

" `"` " (`x22`, double quote) surrounds a [double-quoted flow scalar](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#double-quoted-style).

```
[19] c-double-quote ::= '"'
```

**Example 5.8 Quoted Scalar Indicators**

| ``` single: 'text' double: "text" ``` | ```json { "single": "text",   "double": "text" } ``` |
| --- | --- |

**Legend:**

- `[c-single-quote](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#rule-c-single-quote)`
- `[c-double-quote](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#rule-c-double-quote)`

" `%` " (`x25`, percent) denotes a [directive](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#directives) line.

```
[20] c-directive ::= '%'
```

**Example 5.9 Directive Indicator**

| ``` %YAML 1.2 --- text ``` | ```json "text" ``` |
| --- | --- |

**Legend:**

- `[c-directive](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#rule-c-directive)`

The " `@` " (`x40`, at) and " `` ` `` " (`x60`, grave accent) are *reserved* for future use.

```
[21] c-reserved ::=
    '@' | '\`'
```

**Example 5.10 Invalid use of Reserved Indicators**

| ``` commercial-at: @text grave-accent: \`text ``` | ``` ERROR:  Reserved indicators can't  start a plain scalar. ``` |
| --- | --- |

Any indicator character:

```
[22] c-indicator ::=
    c-sequence-entry    # '-'
  | c-mapping-key       # '?'
  | c-mapping-value     # ':'
  | c-collect-entry     # ','
  | c-sequence-start    # '['
  | c-sequence-end      # ']'
  | c-mapping-start     # '{'
  | c-mapping-end       # '}'
  | c-comment           # '#'
  | c-anchor            # '&'
  | c-alias             # '*'
  | c-tag               # '!'
  | c-literal           # '|'
  | c-folded            # '>'
  | c-single-quote      # "'"
  | c-double-quote      # '"'
  | c-directive         # '%'
  | c-reserved          # '@' '\`'
```

The " `[`", "`]` ", " `{` ", " `}` " and "`,`" indicators denote structure in [flow collections](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#flow-collection-styles). They are therefore forbidden in some cases, to avoid ambiguity in several constructs. This is handled on a case-by-case basis by the relevant productions.

```
[23] c-flow-indicator ::=
    c-collect-entry     # ','
  | c-sequence-start    # '['
  | c-sequence-end      # ']'
  | c-mapping-start     # '{'
  | c-mapping-end       # '}'
```
