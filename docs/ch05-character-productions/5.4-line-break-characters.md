# 5.4. Line Break Characters

YAML recognizes the following ASCII *line break* characters.

```
[24] b-line-feed ::= x0A
```
```
[25] b-carriage-return ::= x0D
```
```
[26] b-char ::=
    b-line-feed          # x0A
  | b-carriage-return    # X0D
```

All other characters, including the form feed (`x0C`), are considered to be non-break characters. Note that these include the *non-ASCII line breaks*: next line (`x85`), line separator (`x2028`) and paragraph separator (`x2029`).

[YAML version 1.1](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#yaml-directives) did support the above non-ASCII line break characters; however, JSON does not. Hence, to ensure [JSON compatibility](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#yaml-directives), YAML treats them as non-break characters as of version 1.2. YAML 1.2 [processors](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#processes-and-models) [parsing](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#parsing-the-presentation-stream) a [version 1.1](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#yaml-directives) [document](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#documents) should therefore treat these line breaks as non-break characters, with an appropriate warning.

```
[27] nb-char ::=
  c-printable - b-char - c-byte-order-mark
```

Line breaks are interpreted differently by different systems and have multiple widely used formats.

```
[28] b-break ::=
    (
      b-carriage-return  # x0A
      b-line-feed
    )                    # x0D
  | b-carriage-return
  | b-line-feed
```

Line breaks inside [scalar content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#scalar) must be *normalized* by the YAML [processor](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#processes-and-models). Each such line break must be [parsed](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#parsing-the-presentation-stream) into a single line feed character. The original line break format is a [presentation detail](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#presenting-the-serialization-tree) and must not be used to convey [content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) information.

```
[29] b-as-line-feed ::=
  b-break
```

Outside [scalar content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#scalar), YAML allows any line break to be used to terminate lines.

```
[30] b-non-content ::=
  b-break
```

On output, a YAML [processor](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#processes-and-models) is free to emit line breaks using whatever convention is most appropriate.

In the examples, line breaks are sometimes displayed using the " `↓` " glyph for clarity.

**Example 5.11 Line Break Characters**

| ``` \|   Line break (no glyph)   Line break (glyphed)↓ ``` | ```json "Line break (no glyph)\nLine break (glyphed)\n" ``` |
| --- | --- | --- |
