# 5.7. Escaped Characters

All non- [printable](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#character-set) characters must be *escaped*. YAML escape sequences use the " `\` " notation common to most modern computer languages. Each escape sequence must be [parsed](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#parsing-the-presentation-stream) into the appropriate Unicode character. The original escape sequence is a [presentation detail](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#presenting-the-serialization-tree) and must not be used to convey [content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) information.

Note that escape sequences are only interpreted in [double-quoted scalars](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#double-quoted-style). In all other [scalar styles](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#node-styles), the " `\` " character has no special meaning and non- [printable](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#character-set) characters are not available.

```
[41] c-escape ::= '\'
```

YAML escape sequences are a superset of C's escape sequences:

Escaped ASCII null (`x00`) character.

```
[42] ns-esc-null ::= '0'
```

Escaped ASCII bell (`x07`) character.

```
[43] ns-esc-bell ::= 'a'
```

Escaped ASCII backspace (`x08`) character.

```
[44] ns-esc-backspace ::= 'b'
```

Escaped ASCII horizontal tab (`x09`) character. This is useful at the start or the end of a line to force a leading or trailing tab to become part of the [content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes).

```
[45] ns-esc-horizontal-tab ::=
  't' | x09
```

Escaped ASCII line feed (`x0A`) character.

```
[46] ns-esc-line-feed ::= 'n'
```

Escaped ASCII vertical tab (`x0B`) character.

```
[47] ns-esc-vertical-tab ::= 'v'
```

Escaped ASCII form feed (`x0C`) character.

```
[48] ns-esc-form-feed ::= 'f'
```

Escaped ASCII carriage return (`x0D`) character.

```
[49] ns-esc-carriage-return ::= 'r'
```

Escaped ASCII escape (`x1B`) character.

```
[50] ns-esc-escape ::= 'e'
```

Escaped ASCII space (`x20`) character. This is useful at the start or the end of a line to force a leading or trailing space to become part of the [content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes).

```
[51] ns-esc-space ::= x20
```

Escaped ASCII double quote (`x22`).

```
[52] ns-esc-double-quote ::= '"'
```

Escaped ASCII slash (`x2F`), for [JSON compatibility](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#yaml-directives).

```
[53] ns-esc-slash ::= '/'
```

Escaped ASCII back slash (`x5C`).

```
[54] ns-esc-backslash ::= '\'
```

Escaped Unicode next line (`x85`) character.

```
[55] ns-esc-next-line ::= 'N'
```

Escaped Unicode non-breaking space (`xA0`) character.

```
[56] ns-esc-non-breaking-space ::= '_'
```

Escaped Unicode line separator (`x2028`) character.

```
[57] ns-esc-line-separator ::= 'L'
```

Escaped Unicode paragraph separator (`x2029`) character.

```
[58] ns-esc-paragraph-separator ::= 'P'
```

Escaped 8-bit Unicode character.

```
[59] ns-esc-8-bit ::=
  'x'
  ns-hex-digit{2}
```

Escaped 16-bit Unicode character.

```
[60] ns-esc-16-bit ::=
  'u'
  ns-hex-digit{4}
```

Escaped 32-bit Unicode character.

```
[61] ns-esc-32-bit ::=
  'U'
  ns-hex-digit{8}
```

Any escaped character:

```
[62] c-ns-esc-char ::=
  c-escape         # '\'
  (
      ns-esc-null
    | ns-esc-bell
    | ns-esc-backspace
    | ns-esc-horizontal-tab
    | ns-esc-line-feed
    | ns-esc-vertical-tab
    | ns-esc-form-feed
    | ns-esc-carriage-return
    | ns-esc-escape
    | ns-esc-space
    | ns-esc-double-quote
    | ns-esc-slash
    | ns-esc-backslash
    | ns-esc-next-line
    | ns-esc-non-breaking-space
    | ns-esc-line-separator
    | ns-esc-paragraph-separator
    | ns-esc-8-bit
    | ns-esc-16-bit
    | ns-esc-32-bit
  )
```
