# 8.2.1. Block Sequences

A *block sequence* is simply a series of [nodes](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes), each denoted by a leading " `-` " indicator. The " `-` " indicator must be [separated](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#separation-spaces) from the [node](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) by [white space](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#white-space-characters). This allows " `-` " to be used as the first character in a [plain scalar](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#plain-style) if followed by a non-space character (e.g. " `-42` ").

```
[183] l+block-sequence(n) ::=
  (
    s-indent(n+1+m)
    c-l-block-seq-entry(n+1+m)
  )+
```
```
[184] c-l-block-seq-entry(n) ::=
  c-sequence-entry    # '-'
  [ lookahead ≠ ns-char ]
  s-l+block-indented(n,BLOCK-IN)
```

**Example 8.14 Block Sequence**

| ``` block sequence: ··- one↓   - two : three↓ ``` | ```json { "block sequence": [     "one",     { "two": "three" } ] } ``` |
| --- | --- |

**Legend:**

- `[c-l-block-seq-entry(n)](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#rule-c-l-block-seq-entry)`
- `auto-detected [s-indent(n)](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#rule-s-indent)`

The entry [node](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes) may be either [completely empty](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#example-empty-content), be a nested [block node](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#block-nodes) or use a *compact in-line notation*. The compact notation may be used when the entry is itself a nested [block collection](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#block-collection-styles). In this case, both the " `-` " indicator and the following [spaces](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#white-space-characters) are considered to be part of the [indentation](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#indentation-spaces) of the nested [collection](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#collections). Note that it is not possible to specify [node properties](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#node-properties) for such a [collection](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#collections).

```
[185] s-l+block-indented(n,c) ::=
    (
      s-indent(m)
      (
          ns-l-compact-sequence(n+1+m)
        | ns-l-compact-mapping(n+1+m)
      )
    )
  | s-l+block-node(n,c)
  | (
      e-node    # ""
      s-l-comments
    )
```
```
[186] ns-l-compact-sequence(n) ::=
  c-l-block-seq-entry(n)
  (
    s-indent(n)
    c-l-block-seq-entry(n)
  )*
```

**Example 8.15 Block Sequence Entry Types**

| ``` -° # Empty - \|  block node -·- one # Compact ··- two # sequence - one: two # Compact mapping ``` | ```json [ null,   "block node\n",   [ "one", "two" ],   { "one": "two" } ] ``` |
| --- | --- | --- |
