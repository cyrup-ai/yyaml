# 8.2. Block Collection Styles

For readability, *block collections styles* are not denoted by any [indicator](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#indicator-characters). Instead, YAML uses a lookahead method, where a block collection is distinguished from a [plain scalar](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#plain-style) only when a [key/value pair](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#mapping) or a [sequence entry](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#block-sequences) is seen.
