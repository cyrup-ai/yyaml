# 8.1.2. Literal Style

The *literal style* is denoted by the " `|` " indicator. It is the simplest, most restricted and most readable [scalar style](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#node-styles).

```
[170] c-l+literal(n) ::=
  c-literal                # '|'
  c-b-block-header(t)
  l-literal-content(n+m,t)
```

**Example 8.7 Literal Scalar**

| ``` \|↓ ·literal↓ ·→text↓ ↓ ``` | ```json "literal\n\ttext\n" ``` |
| --- | --- | --- |

**Legend:**

- `[c-l+literal(n)](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#rule-c-l+literal)`

Inside literal scalars, all ([indented](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#indentation-spaces)) characters are considered to be [content](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#nodes), including [white space](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#white-space-characters) characters. Note that all [line break](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#line-break-characters) characters are [normalized](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#line-break-characters). In addition, [empty lines](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#empty-lines) are not [folded](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#line-folding), though final [line breaks](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#line-break-characters) and trailing [empty lines](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#empty-lines) are [chomped](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#block-chomping-indicator).

There is no way to escape characters inside literal scalars. This restricts them to [printable](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#character-set) characters. In addition, there is no way to break a long literal line.

```
[171] l-nb-literal-text(n) ::=
  l-empty(n,BLOCK-IN)*
  s-indent(n) nb-char+
```
```
[172] b-nb-literal-next(n) ::=
  b-as-line-feed
  l-nb-literal-text(n)
```
```
[173] l-literal-content(n,t) ::=
  (
    l-nb-literal-text(n)
    b-nb-literal-next(n)*
    b-chomped-last(t)
  )?
  l-chomped-empty(n,t)
```

**Example 8.8 Literal Content**

| ``` \| · ·· ··literal↓ ···↓ ·· ··text↓ ↓ ·# Comment ``` | ```json "\n\nliteral\n·\n\ntext\n" ``` |
